# üõ°Ô∏è TryHackMe CTF Player - C++ Fun Project

Welcome to a small, fun C++ project that prints out my TryHackMe alias, global ranking, and some motivation to keep hacking and learning cybersecurity!

This is purely a light-hearted, personal project to show off my TryHackMe progress and add a hacker-themed twist to a basic C++ console program.
